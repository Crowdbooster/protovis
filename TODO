data/Transform.js
- documentation

data/Scale.js
- consolidate code between scale implementations

layout/Layot.js
- use def("init") to initialize rather than depend on data (link inheritance)
- consolidate code between layout implementations
- documentation across implementations
- allow or require pv.Dom.Node as input, rather than maps?
- standardize node.depth, node.size? otherwise hide internal attributes?
- allow interactive expanding / collapsing of tree nodes?
- layouts should allow user to change the associated data
- layouts should not cache by default

layout/Tree.js
- allow depth and breadth offset to be computed automatically

layout/{Cluster,Partition}.js
- support customized inner/outer radius

layout/Force.js
- specify nodes and links using methods, rather than ctor arguments?
- behaves differently from pv.dom, kind of confusing
- cooling schedule to reduce cpu usage as layout stabilizes
- automatic support for computing layout statically

layout/Treemap.js
- use pv.Dom.Node

mark/Mark.js
- antialias doesn't always work as expected; requires pixel rounding?
- event("ignore") to disable pointer-events?

behavior/*
- documentation, implementation, etc.
- should behaviors automatically re-render?
- pv.Behavior.point ... fuzzy mouseover

physics/Simulation.js
- use a constraint rather than `fixed` property to allow dragging?

physics/LinkConstraint.js
- should support an alpha parameter, like pv.Constraint.position

scene/*
- use array push rather than string concatentation to improve performance?

text/CsvFormat.js
- return an object with a .format method, or the format function?
- should other Formats return a function with a self-reference .format method?

*
- use Object.create instead of pv.extend, if available
- use === and !== instead of == and !=
- force type conversion of input arguments in public API?
